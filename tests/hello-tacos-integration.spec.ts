/*
  These Integration Tests verify interactions between the Dapp and Contract as deployed to the
  blockchain. They aim to test the same functionality the Dapp uses, but outside of a web context.

  Note that the Dapp has both Front-End tests that verify the user interface, and Unit Tests to
  verify core Contract functionality.

  Without these integration tests, we would have to implicitly rely on the Front-End tests to test
  integration with the blockchain. However, those should only really be concerned with ui/widgets.

  All Contracts deployed (or, "originated") to Tezos have to come from a Wallet (or, "implicit")
  address. Furthermore, in order to deploy a contract, the Wallet has to have some funds in it.

  The Account that originates the Contract is the de facto administrator of the contract. We need
  this user for one to test that we can make tacos by calling the `Make(number_of_tacos)` endpoint.
  We also need a second, non-admin user in order to test buying tacos via the `Buy(number_of_tacos)`
  endpoint.

  In order to ensure that we always have funds in the originating/admin account, we use Taqueria's
  facility to dynamically create, instantiate and fund accounts in a given environment. To this end,
  these integration tests ensure that Flextesa is running, and once confirmed, the required test
  accounts mentioned before are provisioned and funded in the local Flextesa sandbox. This ensures
  not only that these tests can be run idempotently, but also that they work first time, everytime.

  Please see the top-level README file for more information.
